## Hey there 👋

I am Sriram Dhanasekaran, a 3rd-year undergrad in electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

I am currently learning machine learning and signal processing applications using Python and MATLAB, as well as a bit of DSA using C++.

I also work with 3-D models and animate them in Blender and Unreal Engine.
